This formula does two different things:
  - Configure clients with specific apt repos
  - Configure servers to be either an apt repo or a caching proxy


To manage clients:
```
include:
  - apt.client
```

To manage an apt repo:
```
include:
  - apt.mirror
```

To manage a caching proxy:
```
include:
  - apt.cache
```

In all cases, appropriate pillar data must be populated.
See the sample.pillar file for details.
